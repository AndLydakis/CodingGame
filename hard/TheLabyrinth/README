BFSPathfinding
This puzzle is all about exploring a 2D grid in an optimized way.
You may implement BFS and a pathfinding algorithm such as A* to find the shortest path between two tiles.

The goal of this puzzle is to explore a map with a fog-of-war until you have found a point of interest and the best path to get back. Take all the time you need on exploration
 (Breadth First Search) because you will need to be certain to have the shortest path to get back to the entrance from the point of interest (Pathfinding).
